                <p>Arts & Activism: PAAFF works towards building community around arts and activism, choosing films and devising programs that can bring community together (not only the AAPI community, but the film community, and other diaspora communities as well), 
                    raising awareness of shared/intersectional issues and experiences.

                <p>
                    Partnership & Access: PAAFF partners with many different community organizations (i.e. VietLead, Cambodian American Girls Empowering, PCDC, and SEAMAAC) every year to ensure that the AAPI community is aware and has access to all of the programs that we have.

                    Meeting Creators: Every year, filmmakers and artists from all over the country attend PAAFF to conduct audience Q&As and to interact with the local Philly community. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to aspiring artists to connect with other creators from around the world to inspire and be inspired by one another!
