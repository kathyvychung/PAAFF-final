                    <p>PAAFF is a nonprofit organization founded in 2008 to educate and expose the Philadelphia region to films by and about Asian Americans bringing year round awareness with exciting events that include tastings, mixers, meet & greets, cultural experiences, and of course, screenings.

                        <br> <br>PAAFF is run by a team of dedicated volunteers who serve in their free time to promote and support films by and about Asian Americans for the people of Philadelphia.</p>
