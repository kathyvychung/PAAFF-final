                    <p>PAAFF is a nonprofit organization founded in 2008 to educate and expose the Philadelphia region to films by and about Asian Americans bringing year round awareness with exciting events that include tastings, mixers, meet & greets, cultural experiences, and of course, screenings. The annual award winning film festival held each November is the first of its kind in Philadelphia. PAAFF is proud to have presented dozens of culturally relevant films and exciting programming to broad and diverse audiences. Main venues include International House of Philadelphia in University City and Asian Arts Initiative in Chinatown North.
            
                        PAAFF is run by a team of dedicated volunteers who serve in their free time to promote and support films by and about Asian Americans for the people of Philadelphia.</p>

                                    <p>Arts & Activism: PAAFF works towards building community around arts and activism, choosing films and devising programs that can bring community together (not only the AAPI community, but the film community, and other diaspora communities as well), 
                                        raising awareness of shared/intersectional issues and experiences.

                                        Partnership & Access: PAAFF partners with many different community organizations (i.e. VietLead, Cambodian American Girls Empowering, PCDC, and SEAMAAC) every year to ensure that the AAPI community is aware and has access to all of the programs that we have.

                                        Meeting Creators: Every year, filmmakers and artists from all over the country attend PAAFF to conduct audience Q&As and to interact with the local Philly community. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to aspiring artists to connect with other creators from around the world to inspire and be inspired by one another!
